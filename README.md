If you are *completely* new to **C**ontinuous **I**ntegration (CI) I recommend reading the [CI Wikipedia Article]. **Note**: The article is quite *text-heavy* but contains all the info you need. Read it! If you have any questions, *ask*! 

I've used [Jenkins/Hudson CI] in the past [@groupon], but found the learning curve a bit steep for new developers. Travis by contrast has a much shallower learning curve!
