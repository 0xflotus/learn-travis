A quick Travis CI (Continuous Integration) Tutorial for Node.js developers

Todo: need to find a good intro image.

> Continuous integration is a process in which all development work 
> is integrated at a predefined time or event and the resulting work 
> is automatically tested and built. The idea is that development errors 
> are identified very early in the process.

If you are *completely* new to **C**ontinuous **I**ntegration (CI) I recommend reading the [CI Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration). **Note**: The article is quite *text-heavy* but contains all the info you need. Read it! If you have any questions, *ask*! 

I've used [Jenkins/Hudson CI](http://jenkins-ci.org) in the past @groupon, but found the learning curve a bit steep for new developers. Travis by contrast has a much shallower learning curve!

The key advantages of Travis:

- Nothing to *Install* (Cloud Based ... *Not Java*!)
- **Free** Both to *Use* and **Open Source** (MIT License) see: http://about.travis-ci.org/
- Integrates nicely with GitHub (without any developer effort!)


Following the [Travis Getting Started](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/) guide:

> Visit: https://travis-ci.org/ and click "**Sign in with GitHub**"





**Note**: If you ever want to stop Travis' accessing to your GitHub account, 
simply visit: https://github.com/settings/applications and click on *Revoke*.

#### Future

- **ALL** The Diagrams on Google Image Search for Continuous Integration are terrible!
https://www.google.com/search?q=continuous+integration&source=lnms&tbm=isch I either need
to make time to draw one or ask someone to do one.
